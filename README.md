In this repository,the main problem I handle with is called "3-partition problem" which is a mathematical NP problem.
I will give an example to explain the problem.
Example: {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}
There is 9 numbers in the array,so how can I put each number into 3 sets respectively in order to make the total
sum of 3 sets is equal.
One solution is : {1,3,4,7}  {6,9}  {2,5,8}   The sum of each set is 15.
So my task is to find such solution by genetic algorithm.
